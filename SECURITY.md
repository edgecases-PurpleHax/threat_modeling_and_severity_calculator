# Security Policy
It is my intention to ensure that this application follows the best security practices. That being said, no one is perfect, and vulnerabilities do occur. I will support all versions
of my applications for 5 years from release with vulnerability remediation/patches as possible. Please see below if you find a vulnerability in my application. 

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please email security@purplehax.com with a description of the vulnerability and any remediation advice. Currently, there is no
payout for bugs, but I will make sure to mention you in this document. 

This is a one person project, so I will try to update you as often as possible on vulnerabilities reported and make sure you are made aware when a remediation does occur.
