- [x] Version 2: Create Threat Modeling
- [x] Version 2: Get the report writing feature to make more sense
- [ ] Get a better set of docs together(Forever a WIP)
- [ ] Do the whole Wiki thing again (Now this needs to be done I suppose)
- [x] Restructure into a project that makes sense(I am done for now, surely I will do it again)
- [x] Start figuring out what else needs to go on this TODO list :rofl:
- [ ] v2.1.x Add in PASTA Threat Modeling Exercise, OWASP Top 10 Threat modeling
- [ ] v2.2.x Add in Attack Trees (Maybe some cool tree generation? meh, maybe)
- [ ] v2.3.x Add in hTMM Model (Have to make this as universal as possible right?)
- [ ] Add a license, that is probably a needed thing since this actually has releases now
- [ ] Add this to the standard Security tools. 
- [ ] Get with someone that doesn't suck at writing test cases, so I don't have to manually test this everytime I do dev on it
